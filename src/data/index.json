      "description": "Front-End development is a critical aspect of web development that focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements users encounter. Responsive design, a cornerstone in this field, ensures seamless experiences across devices. Diving into various frameworks, developers choose tools like React or Angular to enhance user interfaces. JavaScript, a dynamic scripting language, plays a pivotal role, enabling the creation of dynamic content and interactivity. As users increasingly demand richer experiences, Front-End developers continually refine their skills to craft visually appealing, efficient, and engaging websites and applications."

      "description": "Fall King is a 2D vertical platformer built in Unity using C Sharp. Play as a knight and fall as far as you can while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Worked on creating game objects that interact with the game world and the player. Implemented the movement as well as the physics for the player to glide down and interact with the game world. Designed the AI system for two types of enemies that behave differently when the player is in range. Integrated Unity's new input system and separated the logic between hardware input, interactions, and actions.",
